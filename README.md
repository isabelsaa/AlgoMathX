This repo is a playground for feeding mathematical  curiosity.
This repository hosts mathematical algorithms implemented in multiple programming languages. 
The goal is quite simple: take some mathematical ideasa and traslate them into little working implementations, exploring how algorithms behave across languages, paradigms and design choices.
